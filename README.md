## Local development

Currently there is no build engine configured. There was a Grunt configuration
once, but it disappeared. Basically `less` directory should be compiled to `css`
directory and that is probably all.

Main file that contains project styling is `less/theme.less`

## Deployment

Master branch is automaticaly being deployed to Netlify. There is no staging.
